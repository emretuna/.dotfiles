Xfwm4 Theme: RGapsBlend

This theme is created from scratch and doesn't have a license. You can do whatever you want, just don't forget to mention where to download the original project.

PS: Since the theme is flat, I recommend enabling shadows. Snapped windows will have 10-px gaps between eacher other. You may want to set 5-px margins on all screen edges and after the panel/s.

Thank you and enjoy!
